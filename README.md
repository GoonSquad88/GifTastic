# GifTastic

For this homework assignmet, I felt like all the answers were on the activities that we did in class. However the challenge was piecing them together to make a cohesive app. Nonetheless, I succeeded in displaying my array into buttons and generated new buttons when the user types something in the search bar.

However I failed to do these things:
    1. I couldn't display the gifs. I console.log them and they come out so I know the API works just fine.
    2. I don't know how to stop repeat buttons. Meaning if the user types in the same thing twice in the search bar, it will appear. I want to know how to stop that.
    3. And this is a maybe I failed but I couldn't get the gifs to animate and stay still. But thats only because I couldn't display them sooooooo.....
